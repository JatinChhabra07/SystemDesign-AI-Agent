# 🏗️ SystemDesign-Pro: Multi-Agent AI Architect

An industry-grade AI system that automates the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) for system architecture. This project uses a **Multi-Agent State Machine** to research, design, and validate complex technical systems.

## 🚀 Features
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration:** Powered by LangGraph (Planner, Researcher, Architect, Validator).
- **Self-Healing Logic:** Automated feedback loops where a Validator agent reviews and triggers redesigns if technical scores are low.
- **Real-time Research:** Integrated with Tavily API for live technical documentation fetching.
- **Interactive Visuals:** Generates Mermaid.js diagrams for instant architectural visualization.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **LLM:** Llama 3.3-70B (via Groq) / Gemini 1.5 (Fallback)
- **Orchestration:** LangGraph & LangChain
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Asynchronous)
- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **Monitoring:** LangSmith
